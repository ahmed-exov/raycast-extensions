# Stealth AI

In-line AI formatting using Raycast AI. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Select Text**: Highlight any text in any app.
2. **Run Action**: Trigger a "Stealth Action" via Raycast search, hotkey, or alias.
3. **Pasted Result**: The AI processes the text and pastes the result directly over your selection.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

### 1. AI Model Selection
You can change which AI model is used for these actions globally:
- Open **Raycast Settings** (`Command + ,`)
- Navigate to the **AI** tab
- Change the **Quick AI Model** selection.

### 2. Hotkeys & Aliases
To make these actions truly "stealth", it is highly recommended to set up custom hotkeys or aliases for your most used actions:
- Open **Raycast Settings** > **Extensions**
- Search for **Stealth AI**
- Set a **Hotkey** (e.g., `Cmd + Shift + G` for Grammar) or an **Alias** (e.g., `fx`) for each command.

### 3. Custom Prompts (Multiline)
If you want to tweak the prompt for an action:
- Run the action **without selecting any text**.
- Or, click the **"Edit Prompt"** button/shortcut (`Cmd + Shift + E`) in the notification that appears while an action is running.
- This opens a multiline editor where you can customize the prompt to your liking.
